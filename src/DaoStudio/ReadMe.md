This is a C# Avalonia projectâ€”a ChatGPT UI client that supports multiple LLMs. It is somewhat similar to SillyTavern.

Architecture:
This application follows a three-tier architecture.
It is professionally designed, architected, and implemented.
The current folder contains the bussiness layer, while the adjacent DBStorage folder handles storage, and the adjacent DaoStudioUI folder handles UI.

## Logging
This application uses Serilog for structured logging.
