## What is Natural Language Programming?

Natural Language Programming in DaoStudio isn't about "English is the new programming language" ‚Äî it's a structured approach to running natural language scripts on LLMs (which act as processors) using APIs provided by Dao Studio, similar to JavaScript Programming or Python Programming.

NLP aims to solve complex real-world problems in a deterministic and cost-efficient manner.


### The Only Core Concept: Naming

The foundation of our NLP is **Naming** ‚Äî the ability to arbitrarily redefine concepts and act on new definitions. When an LLM misunderstands a concept or lacks domain-specific knowledge, you can "patch" it by providing detailed prompts that refine or redefine the concept.

If you're familiar with philosophy, this is somewhat similar to Wittgenstein's language games or the Chinese concept of ÂêçÂÆ∂ (School of Names).

#### Capabilities

With the Naming tool, you can write scripts to solve any complex problem that humans can solve. Additional parameters like temperature, top-p, and penalties may be configured to fine-tune behavior. 
You can also use lower-cost models for specific concepts or entire scripts, and effectively extend context windows.

**Note:** Traditional agent benchmarks like browsecomp, are not meaningful measures for Dao Studio, as it can achieve perfect scores on any such benchmark through proper scripting.

## Use Cases

Natural Language Programming is ideal for:

**Repetitive tasks for individuals** ‚Äî Programmers, DevOps engineers, and domain experts who want to automate their work without writing traditional code.

**One-time tasks with reusable components** ‚Äî Creating content like social media posts by leveraging components shared by the community.
